# WP-API Key Authentication Plugin

Access your WordPress site's data through an easy-to-use HTTP REST API.

**Important Note:** This is a community project, not an official REST API team project. Please note that this may have security and usability issues.

## About

Allows Key Authentication access to the WordPress JSON API.

# WP CLI

Adds Key Auth key/secret for a user.

```
wp key-auth username [--key=strSIZEis12C] [--secret=strSIZEis48CstrSIZEis48CstrSIZEis48CstrSIZEis48C]
```

## Installation

Drop this directory in and activate it. You need to be using pretty permalinks
to use the plugin, as it uses custom rewrite rules to power the API.

## Issue Tracking

All tickets for the project are being tracked on [GitHub][].
